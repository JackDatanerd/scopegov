  // FIX (deep audit, section 7 — flagship finding): this select's inline
  // documentation had been pasted *inside* the template literal instead of
  // above it, so the "// FIX (section-10 audit, 10-G1): ..." comment lines
  // were sent to PostgREST as literal characters of the select= query
  // string, not stripped as a JS comment. That string isn't valid select
  // syntax, so the query failed on every single request, `project` came
  // back null, and `if (!project) notFound()` below fired unconditionally
  // — every project's detail page 404'd for every user. Moved the comment
  // back above the query (kept verbatim below) and confirmed the select
  // string is now a single clean template literal with no embedded prose.
  //
  // The original 10-G1 finding this was documenting: counter_amount/
  // counter_note were written by the client portal and read by the
  // accept-counter route — but appeared in NO component anywhere. The CO
  // card rendered a primary "Accept counter" button next to the ORIGINAL
  // total, so the agency was accepting a negotiated figure it had never
  // been shown, and the client's reasoning was nowhere in the product.
  // Fetch them so the card can show what's being accepted.
  // FIX (section-12 audit, flagship finding): tax_rate/tax_inclusive
  // weren't selected on change_orders here at all, so BillingTab's "bill
  // against this CO" picker had no way to carry an accepted CO's own tax
  // terms onto the invoice, even if it wanted to — see the matching fix
  // in components/invoices/BillingTab.tsx's pickSource().

  // ProjectDetail's "Regenerate from brief" action can prefill GenerateSowModal
  // from metadata.brief/paymentStructure/revisionRounds. Small jsonb object,
